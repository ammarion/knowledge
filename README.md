# Introduction

[My knowledge wiki](https://wiki.omar.engineer).

This is the beginning of a Gitbook containing everything I know, and it's heavily inspired from [https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge).

In the left corner you can make searches for what content I already indexed or you can simply explore the tree view to the left.

### Other things I wrote and shared {#other-things-i-wrote-and-shared}

I also share my knowledge by writing articles [on Medium](https://medium.com/@obahareth) and my [personal website](https://omar.engineer).

I also love writing code that solves various problems I have and I share it all [on GitHub](https://github.com/obahareth).

### Make your own wiki {#make-your-own-wiki}

You can view other similar to this, continuously updated wikis, [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge#readme).

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.
