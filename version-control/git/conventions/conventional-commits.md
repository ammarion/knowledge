# Conventional Commits

"[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en)" is a specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages.

Example of a subject for a commit adding an ability to parse arrays to a JavaScript parser

`feat(javascript_parser): add ability to parse arrays`

## Why Use Conventional Commits?

- Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
- Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).
- Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders.
- Triggering build and publish processes.
- Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.
