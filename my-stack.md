# My Stack

I currently use a 2019 Dell XPS 13" with Ubuntu on it to work, and my phone's a Samsung Galaxy S10. 

I also share my [Linux setup](https://github.com/obahareth/my-linux) and[ Android setup](https://github.com/obahareth/my-android) on GitHub.

The tools and languages I've used to solve problems across my career as a programmer are [available on StackShare](https://stackshare.io/obahareth/obahareth).
