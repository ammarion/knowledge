# Terminology

* **Feature** - An input variable used to infer things or make predictions.
* **Example** - One "row" \(or entry\) in a data set containing features and possibly labels.
* **Label \(only for supervised learning\)** - An identifier for what an example is. If you're training a machine to detect if a picture contains a cat or not, the label would be the correct answer that you want the machine to be able to answer.
