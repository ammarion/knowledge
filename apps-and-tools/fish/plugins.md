# Plugins

I don't have a lot of plugins because Fish is awesome and comes with great defaults.

I use [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) to manage [my plugins](https://github.com/obahareth/dotfiles).

### Utility <a id="utility"></a>

* â€‹[autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) - A cd command that learns - easily navigate directories from the command line.
* [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) - One version manager for all my programming languages \(no need to have rvm/nvm/etc.\).
* [bass](https://github.com/edc/bass) - Make Bash utilities usable in Fish shell.

### Prompt <a id="prompt"></a>

* [Starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) - Pretty, minimal and fast cross-shell prompt.
