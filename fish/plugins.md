# Plugins

I don't have a lot of plugins because Fish is awesome and comes with great defaults.

I use [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) to manage [my plugins](https://github.com/obahareth/dotfiles).

### Utility <a id="utility"></a>

* ​[autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) - A cd command that learns - easily navigate directories from the command line.
* [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) - One version manager for all my programming languages \(no need to have rvm/nvm/etc.\).

### Prompt <a id="prompt"></a>

* [​Pure](https://github.com/rafaelrinaldi/pure) - Pretty, minimal and fast ZSH prompt.
